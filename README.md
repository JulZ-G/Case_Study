# Case_Study

The Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Logit, Probit and the
Poisson regression models were used for interstate conflict modelling to predict the
probabilities of conflict for a given year. Militarized Interstate Disputes (MID) data from
the Correlates of War project was analysed and model performance evaluated. In-sample
probability predictions were made from 1816 until 2014. A 5-year forecast from 2015
until 2019 was made. The ARIMA model was found not suitable for the binary MID
data set probability predictions. The Logit and the Probit models produced excellent
results with a pseudo-r2 between 0.2 and 0.4 for most countries. The Poisson model
was found to sufficiently forecast the frequency of conflict and was used as input for
out-of-sample predictions each year.
